# The Five Laws of Stupidity

Notes to the [Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O9FFrLpinQ) by [tvlpodcast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4HqlcIjaJNnxFMQGaGnc-Q) on the article by Carlo M. Cipolla.

1. **You always underestimate the number of stupid people.** You often believe that someone are not stupid based on wrong judgment calls.

2. **Stupidity doesn’t correlate with any other trait.** Everyone can be stupid, independent of race, gender, degree, wealth, etc. There are even stupid Nobel price winners. Every category has the same proportion of stupid people.

3. **A stupid person is someone who causes losses to others without benefits to themself.** This means that there is the following matrix:

   |                       | loss to self    | benefit to self    |
   | --------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
   | **benefit to others** | helpless people | intelligent people |
   | **loss to others**    | stupid people   | bandits            |

   Stupid people are consistent in their stupidity.

4. **Non-stupid people underestimate the danger of stupid people.** To deal with or associate with stupid people is always costly.

5. **Stupid people are the most dangerous people on the planet.** They are even more dangerous than bandits, because they don’t follow incentives and thus are not predictable.

You can’t teach stupid people, you can only teach ignorant people.
