# Malcolm Gladwell: Blink ­­– The Power of Thinking Without Thinking

## Introduction: The Statue That Didn’t Look Right

A statue from ancient Greece appears – it seems to be authentic by the judgement of the museum it is offered to. But many experts feel an “intuitive repulsion”, and after further investigation it turns out that the statue is likely a forgery.

### 1. Fast and Frugal

Gamblers unconciously react if they play an unfair card game after about 10 cards by changing their strategy and showing physical signs as higher sweat production. Only after about 40 cards they can formulate a hunch, though, and only after about 80 they can formulate a hypothesis. The brain’s subconcious decision making heuristic is called *fast and frugal*.

### 2. The Internal Computer

The part of the brain responsible for fast-and-frugal thinking is the *adaptive subconcious*. Students could – using this – judge the teaching qualities of a professor from a two-second muted clip of them teaching, and were almost as accurate as students who judged a professor after a whole semester. This book has three goals: 

1. Convince the reader that snap decisions are often good.
2. They are fallible, though. The experts at the museum who first looked at the ancient statue were blinded by the excitement of potentially acquiring a unique exhibit.
3. You can train your adaptive subconcious.

## 1. The Theory of Thin Slices: How a Little Bit of Knowledge Goes a Long Way

A couple talks about an issue related to their relationship: Their dog, which is liked by one person but not by the other. They talk for 15 minutes.

### 1. The Love Lab

These 15 minutes are enough to predict with 90 % accuracy if the couple will be together in 15 years. *Thin-Slicing* is the brain’s ability to find patterns in very narrow slices of experience, subconciously.

### 2. Marriage and Morse Code

Morse operators have a *fist*, that is a unique way of morsing. During the Second World War this was used by the British to identify persons, their positions and movements of German units, from just a few seconds of transmition. Marriages also have a fist.

There is the so-called *sentiment override*, that determines how we interpret an action by our partner. a positive sentiment override judges positively even mean behavior, and a negative sentiment override interprets neutral or good behaviour negatively. Sentiment override changes very slowly.

### 3. The Importance of Contempt

There are 20 emotions that are differentiated to judge a couple’s relation, some are positive, some negative. The positive should outweigh the negatives by a factor of around five. Four emotions are hallmarks for a bad relationship: defensiveness, stonewalling (especially men do it), criticism (especially women do it), and contempt (the most important one).

While people have much difficulties judging the future success of a marriage – even marriage counselors –, if they are told what to look for, they have an 80 % success rate from just a few minutes of analysing a conversation.
