# Malcolm Gladwell: Blink ­­– The Power of Thinking Without Thinking

## Introduction: The Statue That Didn’t Look Right

A statue from ancient Greece appears – it seems to be authentic by the judgement of the museum it is offered to. But many experts feel an “intuitive repulsion”, and after further investigation it turns out that the statue is likely a forgery.

### I.1 Fast and Frugal

Gamblers unconciously react if they play an unfair card game after about 10 cards by changing their strategy and showing physical signs as higher sweat production. Only after about 40 cards they can formulate a hunch, though, and only after about 80 they can formulate a hypothesis. The brain’s subconcious decision making heuristic is called *fast and frugal*.

### I.2 The Internal Computer

The part of the brain responsible for fast-and-frugal thinking is the *adaptive subconcious*. Students could – using this – judge the teaching qualities of a professor from a two-second muted clip of them teaching, and were almost as accurate as students who judged a professor after a whole semester. This book has three goals: 

1. Convince the reader that snap decisions are often good.
2. They are fallible, though. The experts at the museum who first looked at the ancient statue were blinded by the excitement of potentially acquiring a unique exhibit.
3. You can train your adaptive subconcious.

### I.3 A Different and Better World

We pay much attention to our conscious decisions and too little to our fleeting judgements. Goal of this book is to show that both are equally important.

## 1 The Theory of Thin Slices: How a Little Bit of Knowledge Goes a Long Way

A couple talks about an issue related to their relationship: Their dog, which is liked by one person but not by the other. They talk for 15 minutes.

### 1.1 The Love Lab

These 15 minutes are enough to predict with 90 % accuracy if the couple will be together in 15 years. *Thin-Slicing* is the brain’s ability to find patterns in very narrow slices of experience, subconciously.

### 1.2 Marriage and Morse Code

Morse operators have a *fist*, that is a unique way of morsing. During the Second World War this was used by the British to identify persons, their positions and movements of German units, from just a few seconds of transmition. Marriages also have a fist.

There is the so-called *sentiment override*, that determines how we interpret an action by our partner. a positive sentiment override judges positively even mean behavior, and a negative sentiment override interprets neutral or good behaviour negatively. Sentiment override changes very slowly.

### 1.3 The Importance of Contempt

There are 20 emotions that are differentiated to judge a couple’s relation, some are positive, some negative. The positive should outweigh the negatives by a factor of around five. Four emotions are hallmarks for a bad relationship: defensiveness, stonewalling (especially men do it), criticism (especially women do it), and contempt (the most important one).

While people have much difficulties judging the future success of a marriage – even marriage counselors –, if they are told what to look for, they have an 80 % success rate from just a few minutes of analysing a conversation.

### 1.4 The Secrets of the Bedroom

Strangers looking through a college student’s bedroom could judge them better on three of the big five personality traits than their friends: Emotional stability, openness, and conscienciousness; friends are better at judging extraversion and slightly better with agreeableness.

### 1.5 Listening to Doctors

How good a doctor is, is not a good predictor for if they are sued for malpractice. How they treat their patients is, though. The tone of the voice alone (wihtout the words used) is enough to predict if a doctor is sued, because you can read from the voice if they respect the patient: Do they show dominance or concernedness?

### 1.6 The Power of the Glance

In many fields there is a word for having an intuitive understanding of a situation, which is very important to have as an expert in the field: In basketball it is *Court Sense*, in military it is *Coup d’oeil*, in bird watching you need to see a bird’s *giss*; these are all analogs to the fist of Morse operators, and the ability to recognize them instinctively. And they can be trained, as seen with the marriage judgements from 1.3.

## 2 The Locked Door: The Secret Life of Snap Decisions

Famous tennis coach Vic Braden can see a failed double-serve before it happens, but he has no idea how. Similarly, investor George Soros acts on back pain as an indicator if he should invest or not. We need to learn to accept that sometimes we just know but don’t know how or why.

### 2.1 Primed for Action

If people read “nice” words, they act more patiently and kindly afterwards. Imagining oneself as a smart person before a test increases scores. Black people perform 50 % worse on tests after they are reminded of their skin color. Afterwards they are not even aware that that is the cause.

The ventromedial prefrontal cortex filters the importance of events and is needed to link knowledge and action. Addicted people are damaged here: They know that their addiction is hurting them but they can’t derive action from it.

### 2.2 The Storytelling Problem

People don’t know their own dating preferences: Before and some time after a speed dating event, they can clearly state their type, but during the event they are attracted to people who don’t fit the description. But people rationalize their preferences, if asked. They make up stories because the actual reason is hidden from them.

If there is a difficult problem that someone can’t find the solution for, the conscious is blocked. But the subconcious still picks up subtle hints. After solving the puzzle, people believe they came to the solution by some concious process, even though they didn’t.

Most people are unaware of how big of an influence the subconcious is.

## 3 The Warren Harding Error: Why We Fall for Tall, Dark, and Handsome Men

Warren Harding became US president only because of his looks – he just looked like a president. We is considered to be the worst president of all times.

### 3.1 The Dark Side of Thin-Slicing

Sometimes, thin-slicing misleads us, because we don’t reach below the surface with the subconcious, as we normally should. It is blinded by something. The consequence: Mediocre or incapable people assume positions of power, and other judgements make our life difficult.

### 3.2 Blink in Black and White

In *Implicit Association Tests*, one must categorize words or images into combined categories, like “Black or Good” and “White or Bad”. By swapping around the combinations and measuring reaction times, we can make visible subconcious connections we make between concepts. The Race IAT test is the most famous, and it shows that even blacks associate more positively with whites.

This can have real consequences, for example in job applications. For example, majority of CEOs are white men – which is not too surprising – and tall. Being short has a similarly strong influence on income as being black or a woman. This is because tall white men are associated with the qualities of a leader somehow, and subconciously this influences the choice of applicants.

### 3.3 Taking Care of the Customer

In sales, there are two rules: Take care of the customer, and don’t commit the Warren Harding error.

### 3.4 Spotting the Sucker

Car dealers make a lot of commission on suckers, so called lay-downs. They can sell them the sticker price and a whole lot of extras and make more money from one person than from six normal customers. Blacks and Women are subconciously seen as lay-down, even if the dealers are presented with a lot of contrary evidence, leading to blacks getting a worse offer after 40 minutes of bargaining than whites get without any talk.

Trying so hard to spot the sucker prevents many closed deals. It is much more profitable to shoot for consistency instead: Be fair, treat every customer equally, filter out all snap judgements. Customers feel if they are treated well and only make referrals if they are.

### 3.5 Think About Dr. King

IAT Scores are dependent from experiences and immediate environment. If you think of accomplished black people (King, Mandela, Obama, Bolt) before taking the Race IAT, you score much better. This also shows how to reduce subcontious racial bias, and bias against any group, especially minorites: Get exposed to them. The more exposed you are the more positive connotations you build up and the fairer and less biased you become.

## 4 Paul van Ripers Big Victory: Creating Structure for Spontaneity

Paul van Riper was company commander of the Marines in the Vietnam war. While he was there, the Vietnamese always were on the defense and didn’t dare making offensive moves. Rip, as he was called, was always at the frontline. He had a firm voice, he was strict but fair. Later he was contacted by the Pentagon to play as a rogue commander in a war game.

### 4.1 One Morning in The Gulf

The Joint Forces Command creates the hugely expensive *Operation Millennium* war game to test the hypothesis that supreme surveillance and intel can lift the fog of war. The motto is: Today we fight a system, not an army. Rip doesn’t agree; war were too messy to be calculated. The operation is a battle of military philosophies.

Van Riper once met traders and sees in them soul mates: Both traders and generals do the same thing, only difference is that traders bet money, generals bet lives. Generals are very good at making stock market decisions, and traders are very good at war games.

Rip’s Team Red wins the war game easily by not being calculable. He just sees through Team Blue’s strategy and hits it where it is vulnerable. After two days, Team Blue is defeated. They were blinded, similar to how the experts at the museum were in the case of the ancient statue.

### 4.2 The Structure of Spontaneity

Improv seems random, but it isn’t. It is spontaneous, but follows rules. Most important is accepting anything. Most people suppress action, improv actors embrace it. Creating conditions for successful spontaneity is important – van Riper also knows that.

### 4.3 The Perils of Introspection

Managers command their subordinates, not control them. Workers need freedom to be flexible and make decisions on their own.

*Verbal Overshadowing* is the fact that describing a mental image makes it so that we can remember it worse. The verbal description overrides the visual one. Similarly, explaining a flash of insight can bring you out of the flow.

#### 4.4 A Crisis in the ER

Heart Patients take up a lot of time in the ER, but there are many false alerts. This is because doctors collect a lot of data to come to their conclusion, which takes a lot of time. The Goldman algorithm focuses on four aspects only and gives a decision suggestion – it is fast and much more accurate (and consistently so) than doctors using their own judgement. But it was only implemented out of desperation in the underfunded Chicago public hospital – now it is a gold standard.

### 4.5 When Less is More

The doctor-patient relationship is the most important part of an examination; the results are less important. More information doesn’t help with diagnosis (analysis paralysis), and can actively produce a worse outcome. It only increases the confidence of the decision maker. We need to edit/filter before making decisions – in thin-slicing, our subconcious does it. We can’t let ourselves drown in information. In an experiment, customers were ten times as likely to buy jam if they had only 6 types to choose from than if they had 24.

A lot of information does not neccessary help with making good decisions: In chess, we have perfect knowledge, but we are far from certain to win. The most important information is hidden from us: The other player’s mind.

### 4.6 The Millennium Challenge, Part Two

The war game gets repeated, but this time Team Red’s actions are scripted. Team Blue wins, and the Pentagon publicly praises its superior technology. The US then goes on to fight a real war.

## 5 Kenna’s Dilemma: The Right—and Wrong– Way ti Ask People What They Want

Kenna is an extraordinary musician, all experts in the field immediately recognize that. But market-research results were abysmal, so he never made it to the radio.

### 5.1 A Second Look at First Impressions

Clinton used opinion polling in preparation of his presidential campaign and while in office – he brought market analysis to politics. But is polling really reliable? People ar every bad at reasoning through their first impressions, so why should they be able to do that in opinion polling?

### 5.2 Pepsi’s Challenge

In the 80’s, Pepsi did blind taste test and came out on top of Coca Cola – they used these results in marketing. In response, Coca Cola developed the New Coke which had an edge over Pepsi in blind taste tests. People hated it, and Coca Cola was forced to bring back Classic Coke. New Coke quickly went away. On the other hand: Even though Coke is apparently the worse product, it is still the number-one softdrink.

### 5.3 The Blind Leading The Blind

THe siptest is not very useful, because it is the wrong context for thin-slicing; the whole user journey must be taken into account.

Packaging is also important. A customer sees the packaging as part of the product. A good packaging can’t sell a bad product, but it can make or break a good one.

### 5.4 The Chair of Death

A radically new chair was developed to be super ergonomic, but people found its looks appalling. It was launched regardless and after decades on the market it is percieved as elegant.

If we don’t like something, it could be because it is bad – or because it is unusual or weird. Market research is only good relating things to similar things, not in judging how good some radical new invention is.

### 5.5 The Gift of Expertise

Taste testers rate food on vast amounts of factors, and their judgements correlate well with laypeoples’. But other than the latter, the former can explain how they come to the conclusion. If a layperson tries to explain why they like something, their judgement will be impeded. Experts have a better intuition and a better understanding of it; they can correlate intuition with other experiences they had before.

Even if someone can differentiate between two samples in a taste test, only experts can do the triangle test: Of three samples, two are the same and one is different – find out which one. For this, one needs to be able to reason about a taste and keep it in mind for some time.

### 5.6 “It Suchs What the Record Companies Are Doing to You”

In the music industry, tests are not done by experts (as are in the food and packaging industry), so they don’t measure what they are supposed to. This is what screws Kenna over.

## 6 Seven Seconds in the Bronx: The Delicate Art of Mind Reading

Four policemen shot a young black man in the Bronx with 41 bullets, because he “was suspicious”. They misinterpreted his actions and saw a gun where it was only a wallet.

### 6.1 Three Fatal Mistakes

We have the ability to read people’s minds by looking at their face, and even babies can do it.

The policemen misjudged several times: They instantly suspected a man who was just standing in front of his house at night. His couriosity of seeing what happened was interpreted as braze. And when they approached him, he was in terror, which was interpreted as danger by the policemen.

They all got acquitted, because the jury saw an accident in what happened. Protesters saw racism. In fat it is neither: They failed at mind-reading.

### 6.2 The Theory of Mind Reading

Facial expressions convey meaning, especially about emotions. These expressions are universal, not cultural, and one can be trained to recognize them.

### 6.3 The Naked Face

Making a face creates the corresponding emotion, it is not a one-way street. Microexpressions are involuntary, subconcious expressions, typically very short. Most people have difficulties consciously recognizing them. But we are still good at recognizing facial expressions.

### 6.4 A Man, A Woman, and a Light Switch

Autists can’t read facial expressions – they use the same part of the brain for recognizing people as everyone uses for objects. There are situations in which the mind-reading ability gets shut of temporarily, as autists always have.

### 6.5 Arguing with a Dog

If we are aroused, our perception is narrowed but heightened. This can give us the ability to perform extraordinary tasks. But being too excited hinders too many functions – sometimes people can’t even call 911, because they don’t remember or their fingers won’t dial the correct number.

One major reason for police brutality seems to be pursuits. These arouse officers so much that they lose their ability to thin-slice and mind-read, they temporarily get *mind-blind*.

### 6.6 Running out of White Space

*White space* is the time the brain needs to thin-slice, before it can react appropriately. If it doesn’t even have a few seconds, a misjudgement – which is often based in stereotypes – is likely.

Patrols with only one police officer are statistically as safe as buddy systems, but they cause less harm to other people and less complaints. There are protocols to slow everything down – this removes many opportunities for mistakes. Departments with many complaints are often those in which the protocols are not followed strictly.

### 6.7 “Something in My mind Just Told Me I Didn’t Have to Shoot Yet”

An experienced officer catches a teenager with a gun. He doesn’t shoot because he just knows that the boy will drop the weapon – and he is correct.

We can train to improve our thin-slicing in agitating situations, like mind-reading under stress. Experienced officers shoot much less bullets than youger ones.

### 6.8 Tragedy on Wheeler Avenue

The incident in the opening paragraph lasted around seven seconds – not enough time for the young and inexperienced policemen. They were mind-blind and had no white space. This is the reason for this incident.

## Conclusion: Listening with Your Eyes: The Lessons of *Blink*

Abbie Conant is a trombone player who only got the job at Munich Philharmonic orchestra because she played behind a screen, which was rare practice at that time. The auditioners thin-sliced her performance and found her perfect. But then a legal battle ensued after the orchestra discriminated against her, basically on ground of being a woman. She won several court cases. Similarly, a Japanese stumped a committee when he could play a European piece with soul.

### C.1 A Revolution in Classical Music

In the 80’s, the hiring process for orchestras got standardized and more fair – first of all screens. This lead to more women and POC getting the job, because they were the objectively better choice. Without screens, looking at the performers would inhibit on the ability to thin-slice for the hiring committee.

### C.2 A Small Miracle

So, what are the lessons? First, thin-slicing is difficult. You need a lot of training, and you need to be aware of your powers to use them correctly. And secondly, you need to create the right context for thin-slicing. Don’t thin-slice the wrong thing or create an environment that makes you “blind”.
