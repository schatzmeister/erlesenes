# Malcolm Gladwell: Blink ­­– The Power of Thinking Without Thinking

## Introduction: The Statue That Didn’t Look Right

A statue from ancient Greece appears – it seems to be authentic by the judgement of the museum it is offered to. But many experts feel an “intuitive repulsion”, and after further investigation it turns out that the statue is likely a forgery.

### I.1 Fast and Frugal

Gamblers unconciously react if they play an unfair card game after about 10 cards by changing their strategy and showing physical signs as higher sweat production. Only after about 40 cards they can formulate a hunch, though, and only after about 80 they can formulate a hypothesis. The brain’s subconcious decision making heuristic is called *fast and frugal*.

### I.2 The Internal Computer

The part of the brain responsible for fast-and-frugal thinking is the *adaptive subconcious*. Students could – using this – judge the teaching qualities of a professor from a two-second muted clip of them teaching, and were almost as accurate as students who judged a professor after a whole semester. This book has three goals: 

1. Convince the reader that snap decisions are often good.
2. They are fallible, though. The experts at the museum who first looked at the ancient statue were blinded by the excitement of potentially acquiring a unique exhibit.
3. You can train your adaptive subconcious.

### I.3 A Different and Better World

We pay much attention to our conscious decisions and too little to our fleeting judgements. Goal of this book is to show that both are equally important.

## 1 The Theory of Thin Slices: How a Little Bit of Knowledge Goes a Long Way

A couple talks about an issue related to their relationship: Their dog, which is liked by one person but not by the other. They talk for 15 minutes.

### 1.1 The Love Lab

These 15 minutes are enough to predict with 90 % accuracy if the couple will be together in 15 years. *Thin-Slicing* is the brain’s ability to find patterns in very narrow slices of experience, subconciously.

### 1.2 Marriage and Morse Code

Morse operators have a *fist*, that is a unique way of morsing. During the Second World War this was used by the British to identify persons, their positions and movements of German units, from just a few seconds of transmition. Marriages also have a fist.

There is the so-called *sentiment override*, that determines how we interpret an action by our partner. a positive sentiment override judges positively even mean behavior, and a negative sentiment override interprets neutral or good behaviour negatively. Sentiment override changes very slowly.

### 1.3 The Importance of Contempt

There are 20 emotions that are differentiated to judge a couple’s relation, some are positive, some negative. The positive should outweigh the negatives by a factor of around five. Four emotions are hallmarks for a bad relationship: defensiveness, stonewalling (especially men do it), criticism (especially women do it), and contempt (the most important one).

While people have much difficulties judging the future success of a marriage – even marriage counselors –, if they are told what to look for, they have an 80 % success rate from just a few minutes of analysing a conversation.

### 1.4 The Secrets of the Bedroom

Strangers looking through a college student’s bedroom could judge them better on three of the big five personality traits than their friends: Emotional stability, openness, and conscienciousness; friends are better at judging extraversion and slightly better with agreeableness.

### 1.5 Listening to Doctors

How good a doctor is, is not a good predictor for if they are sued for malpractice. How they treat their patients is, though. The tone of the voice alone (wihtout the words used) is enough to predict if a doctor is sued, because you can read from the voice if they respect the patient: Do they show dominance or concernedness?

### 1.6 The Power of the Glance

In many fields there is a word for having an intuitive understanding of a situation, which is very important to have as an expert in the field: In basketball it is *Court Sense*, in military it is *Coup d’oeil*, in bird watching you need to see a bird’s *giss*; these are all analogs to the fist of Morse operators, and the ability to recognize them instinctively. And they can be trained, as seen with the marriage judgements from 1.3.

## 2 The Locked Door: The Secret Life of Snap Decisions

Famous tennis coach Vic Braden can see a failed double-serve before it happens, but he has no idea how. Similarly, investor George Soros acts on back pain as an indicator if he should invest or not. We need to learn to accept that sometimes we just know but don’t know how or why.

### 2.1 Primed for Action

If people read “nice” words, they act more patiently and kindly afterwards. Imagining oneself as a smart person before a test increases scores. Black people perform 50 % worse on tests after they are reminded of their skin color. Afterwards they are not even aware that that is the cause.

The ventromedial prefrontal cortex filters the importance of events and is needed to link knowledge and action. Addicted people are damaged here: They know that their addiction is hurting them but they can’t derive action from it.

### 2.2 The Storytelling Problem

People don’t know their own dating preferences: Before and some time after a speed dating event, they can clearly state their type, but during the event they are attracted to people who don’t fit the description. But people rationalize their preferences, if asked. They make up stories because the actual reason is hidden from them.

If there is a difficult problem that someone can’t find the solution for, the conscious is blocked. But the subconcious still picks up subtle hints. After solving the puzzle, people believe they came to the solution by some concious process, even though they didn’t.

Most people are unaware of how big of an influence the subconcious is.

## 3 The Warren Harding Error: Why We Fall for Tall, Dark, and Handsome Men

Warren Harding became US president only because of his looks – he just looked like a president. We is considered to be the worst president of all times.

### 3.1 The Dark Side of Thin-Slicing

Sometimes, thin-slicing misleads us, because we don’t reach below the surface with the subconcious, as we normally should. It is blinded by something. The consequence: Mediocre or incapable people assume positions of power, and other judgements make our life difficult.

### 3.2 Blink in Black and White

In *Implicit Association Tests*, one must categorize words or images into combined categories, like “Black or Good” and “White or Bad”. By swapping around the combinations and measuring reaction times, we can make visible subconcious connections we make between concepts. The Race IAT test is the most famous, and it shows that even blacks associate more positively with whites.

This can have real consequences, for example in job applications. For example, majority of CEOs are white men – which is not too surprising – and tall. Being short has a similarly strong influence on income as being black or a woman. This is because tall white men are associated with the qualities of a leader somehow, and subconciously this influences the choice of applicants.

### 3.3 Taking Care of the Customer

In sales, there are two rules: Take care of the customer, and don’t commit the Warren Harding error.

### 3.4 Spotting the Sucker

Car dealers make a lot of commission on suckers, so called lay-downs. They can sell them the sticker price and a whole lot of extras and make more money from one person than from six normal customers. Blacks and Women are subconciously seen as lay-down, even if the dealers are presented with a lot of contrary evidence, leading to blacks getting a worse offer after 40 minutes of bargaining than whites get without any talk.

Trying so hard to spot the sucker prevents many closed deals. It is much more profitable to shoot for consistency instead: Be fair, treat every customer equally, filter out all snap judgements. Customers feel if they are treated well and only make referrals if they are.

### 3.5 Think About Dr. King

IAT Scores are dependent from experiences and immediate environment. If you think of accomplished black people (King, Mandela, Obama, Bolt) before taking the Race IAT, you score much better. This also shows how to reduce subcontious racial bias, and bias against any group, especially minorites: Get exposed to them. The more exposed you are the more positive connotations you build up and the fairer and less biased you become.

## 4 Paul van Ripers Big Victory: Creating Structure for Spontaneity

Paul van Riper was company commander of the Marines in the Vietnam war. While he was there, the Vietnamese always were on the defense and didn’t dare making offensive moves. Rip, as he was called, was always at the frontline. He had a firm voice, he was strict but fair. Later he was contacted by the Pentagon to play as a rogue commander in a war game.

### 4.1 One Morning in The Gulf

The Joint Forces Command creates the hugely expensive *Operation Millenium* war game to test the hypothesis that supreme surveillance and intel can lift the fog of war. The motto is: Today we fight a system, not an army. Rip doesn’t agree; war were too messy to be calculated. The operation is a battle of military philosophies.

Van Riper once met traders and sees in them soul mates: Both traders and generals do the same thing, only difference is that traders bet money, generals bet lives. Generals are very good at making stock market decisions, and traders are very good at war games.

Rip’s Team Red wins the war game easily by not being calculable. He just sees through Team Blue’s strategy and hits it where it is vulnerable. After two days, Team Blue is defeated. They were blinded, similar to how the experts at the museum were in the case of the ancient statue.
