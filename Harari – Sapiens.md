# Yuval Noah Harari: Sapiens – A Brief History of Humankind

## Part One: The Cognitive Revolution

### 1. An Animal of No Significance

Because Humans had very big, energy hungry brains, they couldn’t support muscles, and still needed to spend a lot of time gathering food. Standing upright is an advantage, but it caused the birth canal to shrink so that, combined with the big head, human babies need to be born prematurely. This means, that they need a lot of care afterwards – it takes a whole tribe to raise a human. This is probably the reason we have intricate social systems.

The *Homo* genus was, for a long time, in the middle of the food chain. The original niche was probably to use tools for extracting bone marrow from cadavers left over by other animals. Later we rose through the ranks very quickly, faster than the environment could keep up.

Possibly the large brain was also supported by the domestication of fire. Cooking food meant needing less time to eat and no need to support long energy hungry intestines. This could have kick-started the rise of the human. The most successful human, *Homo sapiens* was so successful because of the superior command of language stemming from the *cognitive revolution*, they partly replaced, partly interbred with other species, until only the Sapiens were left.

### 2. The Tree of Knowledge

By 150,000 YBP (years before present) humans existed in Eastern Africa, but only around 70 kYBP they started conquering the world. This probably happened because of the evolution of a new kind of language – the cognitive revolution. The new language could be used in several groundbreaking ways:

- *Intricate descriptions* allowed for making plans, cooperation, and complex action,
- *Gossip* lets us judge trustworthiness, enables trade through creating common grounds, bigger tribes, …  – it is still very important to us – and
- *Fiction* makes collaboration more flexible through many individuals who share myths and beliefs.

Small groups under around 150 individuals (cf. Dunbar’s number) can be managed by intimate knowledge of another, bigger ones need a common myth. Social constructs are not objectively there, but that doesn’t make them lies. People actually believe in gods, money, corporations, hierarchies, states, rights, laws, and so on. It is an imagined reality, but a reality nonetheless.

Language and common myths allowed, for the first time, to decouple behavior change from genetic change. Thought leaders don’t need to have physical offspring to procreate their myths. At this point, biology got replaced by history. Note that biology is not completely gone, though, history still happens within the borders of biology.

Why did Neanderthals get replaced? They likely didn’t trade, Sapiens traded over long distances; this is the result of superior language. One of the most important traded goods: knowledge.

### 3. A Day in the Life of Adam and Eve

We are probably very similar to early Sapiens physiologically. For example, we still like sweet food, because they were vital for survival before food was abundant.

People barely had physical belongings, because they, as nomads, had to transport them on foot from one place to another. There were no domesticated animals, except dogs from around 15 kYBP.

To find out more about ancient humans, we can study contemporary hunter-gatherer tribes, but we have to be careful because of three factors:

- They are influenced by surrounding societies,
- they live in inhospitable environments which definitely shaped their culture, and
- there is a huge variety between these societies.

This means we can only make educated guesses about the *horizon of possibilities* for early societies. Tribes probably consisted of less than a few hundred people in several bands with a common culture and language; trade happened, but contact was rare, bands were self-sufficient. Most were nomadic, but there were some seasonal or permanent settlements, e.g. fishing villages in Indonesia from around 45 kYBP.

Sapiens was mostly a gatherer, less a hunter, the most important good being information. There was little to no specialization, everybody could do everything. Everybody was fit because of permanent exercise and a perfect food composition – the food was varied and failing food sources could easily be replaced. People lived up to 60 years and older (modulo child mortality), starvation was rare, as were infectious diseases, since most of them are zoonoses and epidemics can’t happen without intensive contact between groups. They were tall as people are today.

Animism was probably widespread, but we don’t know any specifics, also not about sociopolitics. Maybe early societies were non-monogamous, communist, and without a core family. Maybe none of those. But most likely they were very different to another. Violence could have been regular or rare, it probably depended. 

### 4. The Flood

The cognitive revolution enabled the settlement of Australia around 45 kYBP and America around 14 kYBP, and these spaces were shaped vastly by humans. Wherever they went, they brought extinction of animals and plants: Local (mega-)fauna didn’t evolve fearing humans, deliberate burns shaped the environment (for example, the fire-resistant eucalyptus only became a dominant species after humans invaded Australia). Climate change may also be a factor, but not the most important one. Later we will see that also the agricultural and industrial revolutions caused and cause massive extinctions.

## Part Two: The Agricultural Revolution

### 5. History’s Biggest Fraud

Domestication started around 11 kYBP and finished around 5500 YBP. 90 % of the calorie intake worldwide comes from domesticated plants and animals.

The agricultural revolution happened several times and then spread around the world. It only happened in specific places, because only certain species are amenable to domestication.

Agriculture lead to lives with more work, a worse, less varied and less secure diet, and less leisure time; but population exploded. First, humans got domesticated by plants (mainly wheat, potatoes, and rice). Wheat is the most successful plant on earth, reproductively. But it leads to an unhealthy diet, dependence on the food creates the need for stockpiles. Human bodies didn’t evolve for field work, increasing prevalence of physical illnesses like hernia, arthritis, and slipped disks. Diseases could spread more easily, and there were more wars for land and property.

The few advantages are that villages offer better protection against animals and weather. But the biggest advantage is not on an individual, but an evolutionary level: Population increased by 5 to 10 times.

Farming was a trap: It lured people in slowly, over generations, and then you can’t go back, because gathering wouldn’t support the community. Also, if there are farmers around you, they will replace you over the time.

Göbekli Tepe is a (probably) religious site built by hunter-gatherers around 11.5 kYBP over decades. Near the site, one of the first signs of cultivated wheat were found. This means that agriculture supported the construction, and the construction did not come after the fact.

There are two ways of animal domestication: Hunting selectively, until only “good” animals are left, and gradually confining them. Or: Catching young animals and raising them for slaughter, now and then keeping them into adulthood and breeding them.

### 6. Building Pyramids

The agricultural revolution also was a revolution in many other aspects: architecture, houses, artificial plots of land, many more personal belongings, the sense of property. Home is a house, not a large area of land.

Agriculture made possible and necessary to plan for and worry about the future – you need surplus for hard times, but most of it is taken by the wealthy elite.

Many people lived together now, needing organization. Politics and law got created, empires arose. 221 BC, Qin dynasty China had 40 million inhabitants; Rome, at its height, 100 million, with a standing army of up to 500,000 men. People needed to cooperate, often not voluntarily (serfs, slaves, prisoners, …).

Laws, rights and so on are only fictions, but they are still useful as long as people believe in them. But: An imagined order may collapse at any time, other than a natural one (imagine gravity stopping). Order is kept in part by violence, but it needs true believers – at least those causing the violence. Violence is the most difficult to organize collective activity.

It is helpful if there is some authority – like a god – commanding the order. There are three main factors to keep believing:

1. The order is embedded in the material world. Whatever we do, we are reminded of our beliefs and act within their limits.
2. It shapes our desires.
3. It is intersubjective, making it stable against minority non-believers.

Changing an order needs cooperation, which necessitates an alternative, bigger myth or order. This means that we are trapped in these myths for eternity.

### 7. Memory Overload

Human brains have evolved to store social, zoological, botanical, and topological information, but large societies use a lot of numeral data. This is why the first writing was a partial script for accounting. Partial, because it wasn’t suitable for any other applications. Inca used colorful, knotted threads, *quipus*, showing that writing can have many forms.

Cuneiform (3000 BCE) is the first full script. Stories were still mostly an oral tradition, but script and bureaucracy are linked closely. Bureaucracy, then changes our minds. Naturally, brains work in free, holistic association, but to keep order, we need compartmentalizing and archiving brains. A modern form of script comes with the advent of computers, which needs another rewiring of brains.

### 8. There Is No Justice In History

In History, imagined order always created differences, no completely egalitarian society is known to us. If at all, they are only sustainable by intimate relationships. Hierarchies often arise by chance and may change and evolve – especially when strengthening the current elite. A common theme is pollution; subjugated groups are often seen as impure in some form.

Example: Blacks were not as susceptible to diseases, because they had developed more resistances. This made them better agricultural slaves because of an economic benefit. Because nobody wants to admit they discriminate against a group of people for economic reasons, excuses were found. Even after the end of slavery, they got perpetuated, and arguably even worse due to feedback loops – the socioeconomic background of a person is the best predictor for how well off they will be in the future.

Excuses are often found in “natural” reasons, but what does it mean for something to be natural? *Biology enables, culture forbids.*

The only universal difference is gender disparities, almost always men rank higher than women. There are several explanations for this fact, but they all have flaws:

- Men are physically stronger and can thus subjugate women. But regularly, the most powerful people are not strong. Often they are old men, who are physically weak.
- Men are more aggressive, giving them more influence in the military and by proxy in civil contexts. But elites often don’t fight themselves (they don’t have to rise through the ranks), and being thoughtful and empathetic is seen as a good trait of a leader.
- Women depend on men during pregnancy and while caring for small children. But why on men? In elephants and bonobos, strong female cooperation lead to matriarchies where the males are on their own. Women are often characterized as more cooperative, but still men lead cooperative societies.

## Part Three: The Unification of Humankind

### 9. The Arrow of History

The set of artificial intuitions a group of humans gives themselves is called culture. In the past, it was assumed that culture only changes due to outside influences, but nowadays, it is clear that it is in a constant flux due to inherent inconsistencies. In medieval Europe, it was Christianity against chivalry, today it is equality versus freedom. Cognitive dissonance is an essential part of culture, it is an asset.

While over short periods (decades and centuries), it may seem that the number of cultures fluctuates in both directions, over the millennia, the trend is clear: Humanity gets more and more united. Today, almost all humans live under the same geopolitical, economic, international legal, and scientific systems. Moreover, what we consider authentic for a culture, or ethnic, is normally a recent development: Native Americans and their horses, Polish and Irish potatoes, Swiss chocolate, Italian tomato sauce, … are all less than 500 years old.

All social animals categorize in *us and them*, where *them* is every individual not intimately known. Using culture, this changes to *us and potentially us*, because outsiders could at any time adopt our culture. The three biggest unifiers in history were: money, imperialism, and religion. 

### 10. The Scent of Money

Early societies were based on favors, obligations and occasional barter with outsiders. But the more specialization there is the more difficult bartering becomes – it can’t sustain a complex economy. Central barter systems, that is every person barters only with a central authority, were tried, but didn’t work too well (see the Soviet Union). Money is the easiest exchange medium. It is universal, can be stored, and can be transported easily.

*Money is the most universal and […] efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.* But this trust must be built over time. At first, money has an inherent value, like barley seeds with ancient Sumerians. Later, it had no intrinsic value anymore, like with the Mesopotamian shekel – which is around 8 grams of silver – only trust in the exchange value of the metal is needed. The third step is coins. They are weighed, and their value is guaranteed by the king. Counterfeit is lèse-majesté, an offense against the king personally, and punished harshly. In this step, the only trust needed is in the authority.

Cold and coins spread from Lydia over the whole world, because money doesn’t need you to believe in it to work, it only needs you to believe that others believe in it. Therefore, if someone else finds coins valuable, you also have an interest in gaining hold of them.

Money creeps into many spheres, but there are always taboos on what should be able to be bought and what not (and the taboos are, of course, broken). The biggest impact is that money carries trust, so we don’t need to trust strangers anymore. We only need to trust their money. On the other hand, this undermines our trust in someone if no money is involved.

### 11. Imperial Visions

Stories of barbarians were very successful in the Roman Empire, and often they are the only source for the subdued tribes. The barbarians never won, and their cultures are completely lost. Most notable is the language. Almost all humans speak (the descendant of) an imperial language nowadays.

Most peoples’ names just mean “people”, excluding anybody who is not part of the people. Empires, on the other hand, are *inclusive*, they have ambitions to rule over the whole world. The ruling elite often believes that they spread their culture to barbarians for their sake; but the empire also incorporates local traditions into a large amalgamate.

It takes time, but after some time, the conquered are seen as equal: Late Roman emperors were mostly not of italic descend. There is an imperial circle:

- A small group dominates its neighbors and becomes the major power in the region.
- An imperial culture develops; the dominating group sees itself as superior, spreading culture to barbarian outsiders.
- The imperial culture spreads.
- Subjects demand equal status, after adjusting to the dominant culture.
- The founders of the empire lose dominance, the empire collapses.
- The imperial culture lives on, without the empire.

Reverting the influence of an empire is almost impossible, and it would most likely get back to a state of a previous, smaller empire. Empires get more and more encompassing, and a global empire is imminent.

### 12. The Law of Religion

Myths are fragile, they can – other than biology – be changed at any time. Religion is a way to stabilize a myth by using super-human (note: not super-natural) legitimacy. Thus, besides money and empires, religion is the third big unifier.

A religion has two defining properties: It is a set of rules and norms to be followed, and it has super-human legitimacy. Therefore, believing in ghosts (lacking the first) and football (lacking the second) are not religions.

A successful religion has two more factors: It is universal – the superhuman is everywhere – and it is missionary. Such religions only really emerged around 1000 BCE.

Early religions were local and exclusive, but the agricultural revolution came with a religious as well: Plants and animals are no longer seen as equal but as property; gods mediate between them and humans. This exalted not only gods but also humans who were the only ones who could talk to gods.

Polytheistic religions tend to believe in a universal, impartial, and uninterested power (like fate) and in gods with partial powers and interests, which are also subject to this power. This is a good basis for tolerance. Most polytheistic religions also have animistic remains like local spirits.

Over time, some tribes regarded one god as the most important one, ending worship of the others (henotheism, evolving into local or temporary monotheism). Monotheistic religions tend to be more fanatic – they don’t allow other gods after all – but elements of polytheism remain (like saints in Catholicism). Monotheism also has the problem of theodicy, dualism (meaning a good and an evil force fighting each other) can solve this, see for example Zoroastrianism. But dualism has difficulties explaining order – there needs to be a common rule for the fight between the two forces.

In the end, all religions are *syncretic*, taking ideas from multiple sources. The single world religion might be a syncretism.

There are natural-law religions that don’t appeal to a god, like Buddhism, in which the central question is not “God exists. How can I please him?” but “Suffering exists. How can I remove me from it?”. But these religions don’t move away from gods or saints (see Bodhisattva).

Ideologies like liberalism, communism, and capitalism are also religions according to our definition, and have the same markers: martyrs, holy wars, heretics, holidays, prophets and holy scriptures. They are also syncretic – you can believe in several ideologies at the same time.

The most widespread religion nowadays is humanism. It comes in three forms:

1. *Liberal humanism:* Each human, individually, is sacred, there are human rights. This is rooted in monotheism, especially Christianity.
2. *Social humanism:* The whole species is sacred, collectively. Nothing should stand over the human essence, ensuring equality between humans. For example, if money comes with power, that means that wealth is valued higher than the human essence – which cannot be. Social humanism is also rooted in Christianity.
3. *Evolutionary humanism:* The human species can evolve – for the better or the worse. The sacred value is to help humanity to become better. A prime example for this type of ideology is Nazism.

### 13. The Secret of Success

We can explain *how* things happened but not *why*. *A* global society was probably inevitable, but not *this one*. It happened mostly by chance.

Politics is chaotic, and it cannot be predicted (the act of predicting would change the outcome). This means we can only study history to broaden our understanding of how arbitrary it is. Its goal is not to predict the future.

Politics also doesn’t evolve to increase well-being. Just how genes are successful if they make the species fitter – and not the individual – memes are successful, if they spread. For example, game theory shows that in many of the studied scenarios the best action for an individual lets everybody be worse off.

## Part Four: The Scientific Revolution

### 14. The Discovery of Ignorance

The scientific revolution changed the world rapidly and radically. In a few decades, the world changed more than in centuries before. This came from a different way of trying to understand the world: While before, people thought that all interesting questions were already answered (mostly by the holy scriptures), we now admit that there are interesting things that we still don’t know. We systematically create theories using observation and mathematics, and use the theories to gain new powers and technologies.

The problem coming from this: Myths are also not ultimate wisdom anymore, making them unstable. To keep stable systems, we must either keep science out of politics, or declare certain scientific insights as final. The Nazis did this with their race theory, unsuccessfully.

Fundamental to science is the use of the language of math. The advent of statistics was the most important, because it meant that even harder-to-formalize fields could use math and legitimize themselves.

Knowledge is power, meaning the truth of a theory is secondary. Most important is that is useful. Still, the link between science and technology is a recent phenomenon. Science, industry and military technology only really intertwined during the industrial revolution.

There are two kinds of poverty: Social poverty is people missing out on opportunities others have. Biological poverty is people having no access to enough resources to fulfill their biological needs. While the first one still exists, the second one is in large parts eradicated – something nobody could imagine just a few centuries ago. Maybe the first one will be gone soon as well.

The biggest project of the scientific revolution is ending death – another thing accepted as inevitable fact before. Best improvements were made in child mortality: 25–30 percent children died as recently as a hundred years ago, nowadays, it is less than one percent. Age expectancy rose from 25–40 years to 60–80. A-mortality (meaning not dying of natural causes anymore) could be achieved by some people before the end of the century. A sign of that is that religions (that is ideologies) don’t talk about death anymore, even though it was central to many religions before.

Science is very expensive, though, and only politics and religion can decide what research should be financed.
