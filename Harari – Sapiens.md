# Yual Noah Harari: Sapiens – A Brief History of Humankind

## Part One: The Cognitive Revolution

### 1. An Animal of No Significance

Because Humans had very big, energy hungry brains, they couldn’t support muscles, and still needed to spend a lot of time gathering food. Standing upright is an advantage, but it caused the birth canal to shrink so that, combined with the big head, human babies need to be born prematurely. This means, that they need a lot of care afterwards – it takes a whole tribe to raise a human. This is probably the reason we have intricate social systems.

The *Homo* genus was, for a long time, in the middle of the food chain. The original niche was probably to use tools for extracting bone marrow from cadavers left over by other animals. Later we rose through the ranks very quickly, faster than the environment could keep up.

Possibly the large brain was also supported by the domestication of fire. Cooking food meant needing less time to eat and no need to support long energy hungry intestines. This could have kickstarted the rise of the human. The most successful human, *Homo sapiens* was so successful because of the superior command of language stemming from the *cognitive revolution*, they partly replaced, partly interbred with other species, until only the Sapiens were left.

### 2. The Tree of Knowledge

By 150.000 YBP (years before present) humans existed in Eastern Africa, but only around 70 kYBP they started conquering the world. This probably happened because of the evolution of a new kind of languge – the cognitive revolution. The new language could be used in several groundbreaking ways:

- *Intricate descriptions* allowed for making plans,  cooperation, and complex action,
- *Gossip* lets us judge trustworthiness, enables trade through creating common grounds, bigger tribes, …  – it is still very important to us – and
- *Fiction* makes collaboration more flexible through many individuals who share myths and beliefs.

Small groups under around 150 individuals (cf. Dunbar’s number) can be managed by intimate knowledge of another, bigger ones need a common myth. Social constructs are not objectively there, but that doesn’t make them lies. People actually believe in gods, money, corporations, hierarchies, states, rights, laws, and so on. It is an imagined reality, but a reality nonetheless.

Language and common myths allowed, for the first time, to decouple behavior change from genetic change. Thought leaders don’t need to have physical offspring to procreate their myths. At this point, biology got replaced by history. Note that biology is not completely gone, though, history still happens within the borders of biology.

Why did Neanderthals get replaced? They likely didn’t trade, Sapiens traded over long distances; this is the result of superior language. One of the most important traded goods: knowledge.

### 3. A Day in the Life of Adam and Eve

We are probably very similar to early Sapiens physiologically. For example, we still like sweet food, because they were vital for survival before food was abundant.

People barely had physical belongings, because they, as nomads, had to transport them on foot from one place to another. There were no domesticated animals, except dogs from around 15 kYBP.

To find out more about ancient humans, we can study contemporary hunter-gatherer tribes, but we have to be careful because of three factors:

- They are influenced by surrounding societies,
- they live in inhospitable environments which definitely shaped their culture, and
- there is a huge variety between these societies.

This means we can only make educated guesses about the *horizon of possibilities* for early societies. Tribes probably consisted of less than a few hundred people in several bands with a common culture and language; trade happended, but contact was rare, bands were self-sufficient. Most were nomadic, but there were some seasonal or permanent settlements, e. g. fishing villages in Indonesia from around 45 kYBP.

Sapiens was mostly a gatherer, less a hunter, the most important good being information. There was little to no specialization, everybody could do everything. Everybody was fit because of permanent exercise and a perfect food composition – the food was varied and failing food sources could easily be replaced. People lived up to 60 years and older (modulo child mortality), starvation was rare, as were infectious deseases, since most of them are zoonoses and epidemics can’t happen without intensive contact between groups. They were tall as people are today.

Animism was probably widespread, but we don’t know any specifics, also not about sociopolitics. Maybe early societies were non-monogamous, communist, and without a core family. Maybe none of those. But most likely they were very different to another. Violence could have been regular or rare, it probably depended. 

### 4. The Flood

The congitive revolution enabled the settlement of Australia around 45 kYBP and America around 14 kYBP, and these spaces were shaped vastly by humans. Wherever they went, they brought extinction of animals and plants: Local (mega-)fauna didn’t evolve fearing humans, deliberate burns shaped the environment (for example, the fire resistent eucalyptus only became a dominant species after humans invaded Australia). Climate change may also be a factor, but not the most important one. Later we will see that also the agricultural and industrial revolutions caused and cause massive extinctions.
