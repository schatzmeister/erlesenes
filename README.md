In this repository, I keep track of all the notes I make while reading
books. The files are Markdown formatted and have titles of the form:
	`<Last name of author’s name> – <Book’s title>.md`

Unfortunately, for now all notes are German, but maybe some in English
will follow.

Additonally, there is a python script building a summary of a file,
if run. It just appends all __bold__ paragraphs to the end of the file.
