# Patrick Winston: How to Speak

These are notes on [the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY) given at MIT.

* Starting with a joke is okay, but best is to start with a promise: What will the audience have learned after the talk?
* Framework:
  * Cycle – say everything three times
  * Build a fence – distinguish what you say from what others say
  * Verbal punctuation – have landmarks for people who have zoned out for a moment; enumerate, have an outline, …
  * Ask questions – not too hard, not to easy; you can wait for 10 seconds for the answer
* Time and Place:
  * 11:00 AM is the best time – people are not sleepy anymore, and not yet hungry or food comatose
  * The place should be well-lit
  * The room should have the right size: at least half full, but not crammed
  * Scout the place beforehand
* Use the blackboard for informing, and slides for exposure
  * Boards are graphic
  * writing speed is thinking speed
  * you can connect parts of the board and use it as target for your hands – you don’t even need to point to relevant things.
* Props make envisioning things easier and are memorable
* Presentations:
  * There are always too many words and too many slides
  * Do not read
  * Be in the image – the audience can’t watch tennis
  * Keep images simple
  * eliminate clutter – you don’t need logos, title or bullet points
  * Don’t use a laser pointer; use arrows instead
  * Clutter crime: The whole talk should fit onto a single A4 page without feeling cluttered
  * One single slide may be complex, if the audience is supposed to feel overwhelmed by it.
* Inspiration: Exhibit passion for the topic.
* Use stories and questions
* For oral exams: practice your talk, situate
* Job talks:
  * Express your vision: Problem and approach
  * Contributions: What are the steps to reach your vision?
* Getting famous:
  * Why? You get used to being famous, but not to being ignored
  * How? The Winston star helps your work to be recognized, consisting of a Symbol, a Slogan, a Surprise, a Salient Idea (that sticks out), and a Story (how and why)
* How to stop:
  * The final slide is your contributions, everything else (collaborators are on the first slide) is wasted real estate. What have you done this talk?
  * For the final words, a joke is okay, also rituals like shaking the hosts hand; best is saluting/expressing gratitude/happiness/excitement. Don’t thank the audience
